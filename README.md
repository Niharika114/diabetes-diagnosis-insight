## **Diabetes Diagnosis Insight Tool**  
**Bridging Machine Learning and Frontend Innovation**

### **Project Vision**  
This project was born from the desire to simplify the complexity of machine learning and deliver it through an intuitive, accessible web application. By integrating a robust predictive model with a modern React frontend, the tool aims to make healthcare analytics both understandable and user-friendly, turning advanced technology into an interactive learning experience.

### **Technical Highlights**

#### **Seamless Technology Integration**
- Integrated a Python-based machine learning backend with a responsive, real-time React frontend  
- Designed and implemented a `/predict` API endpoint for live inference  
- Leveraged Vite and TypeScript to ensure a performant and type-safe development environment

#### **Machine Learning Implementation**
- Developed a Random Forest classifier with fine-tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV  
- Evaluated and compared multiple classification algorithms for performance trade-offs  
- Utilized the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset to convert clinical data into meaningful, real-time predictions

### **Design & User Experience**

#### **Modern, Accessible UI**
- Built a sleek, responsive interface using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components  
- Prioritized accessibility and user-centric design via Headless UI patterns  
- Created reusable and dynamic components to communicate complex data clearly and concisely

### **Core Components**

- **DiabetesForm**  
  A dynamic input form featuring real-time validation with React Hook Form, allowing users to input health metrics effortlessly.

- **PredictionCard**  
  A visual display of the prediction outcome with intelligent risk-level indicators and conditional styling based on model results.

- **DarkModeToggle**  
  Implemented using Radix UI primitives for seamless theme toggling, styled consistently with shadcn/ui conventions.

### **What Sets This Project Apart**  
While the project uses the publicly available Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, every aspect—from machine learning architecture to UI design—was developed from the ground up. This reflects a hands-on exploration of how artificial intelligence and frontend technologies can be combined to create impactful, educational tools.
